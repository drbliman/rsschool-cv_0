### _Briefly About Myself:_

Due to my love to science, desire for continuous self-education and easy learner, I have worked for an amazing three years in the field of education. However, the desire to move forward led me to the profession of Frontend Developer. After I completely switched to commercial education, I had enough free time to learn new skills. After four months of self-study of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I realized that I wanted to do it professionally. I believe that I will succeed and become a highly skilled professional.
